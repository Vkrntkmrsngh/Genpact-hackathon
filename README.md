# Genpact-hackathon
This Repository consist codes of different algorithms used in this problem

This hackathon was organised by Analyticsvidya and sponsered by Genpact.
It was problem of regression.
we had to predict number of order in a given week if we are given number of features.
Catboost came to be best algorithm for me on this dataset.

You can refer Catboost Algorithm final submission.py file to check the approcah taken to solve the problem.
